link-spot
=========
The link-spot project is a test bed for learning AngularJS.  It is a primative clone of sites like
dzone, digg, reddit, etc.  This is for playing purposes only.

The application is using the following technologies:

* Grails 2.2.3
* AngularJS 1.0.7
* Bootstrap 2.3.2 (Yes, I used Bootstrap and no, I did not customize it. Bugger off if you don't approve).

#### Current Features
* view list of articles
* add new article (anonymous)
* vote on article (anonymous)

#### TODO (order is arbitrary)
* tests - There are clearly no tests yet.  That's because I haven't figured out how to get the test stuff running on my machine.
* form validation
* authentication
* comments
